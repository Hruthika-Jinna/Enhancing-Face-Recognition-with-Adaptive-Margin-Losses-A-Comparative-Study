# Enhancing-Face-Recognition-with-Adaptive-Margin-Losses-A-Comparative-Study
This study investigates the efficiency of three advanced loss functions—CosFace, ArcFace, and 
AdaFace—for face recognition. AdaFace, a novel loss function that enhances face recognition 
performance on low-quality datasets. AdaFace adapts margin values based on difficulty, 
leveraging feature norms as an image quality proxy. We evaluate CosFace, ArcFace, and 
AdaFace within a CNN framework on LFW-DeepFunneled dataset. The study highlights the 
critical role of selecting an appropriate loss function tailored to the specific dataset, with 
CosFace emerging as a promising choice. Future exploration could optimize ArcFace and 
AdaFace for similar scenarios, potentially enhancing their performance
